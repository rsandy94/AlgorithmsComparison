There are 2 code files in ipynb format:
1) One is for Energy data named - EnergyData_ANN_and_KNNipynb.ipynb
2) Another is for Austraila weather- AustraliaWeather_ANN_and_KNN.ipynb

There are 2 data files:
1) energyata_complete 
2) weatherAUS

Before running the code the following libraries need to be installed:
tensorflow, Keras, numpy, pandas, matplotlib,sklearn,scipy

After that, to run the code, just open the code files and run without changing any file paths as i have not used any directory.
